# Cats-vs-dogs-image-Classification
Image classification of cats vs dogs using TensorFlow and Keras typically involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - Obtain a dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is usually split into training and testing sets.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Resize images to a consistent size.
   - Normalize pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
   - Shuffle and augment the training data to improve model generalization.

3. **Model Architecture:**
   - Build a CNN using Keras. A common architecture consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
   - Example model:
     ```python
     from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
     from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

     model = Sequential()
     model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(image_height, image_width, 3)))
     model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
     model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
     model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
     model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
     model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
     model.add(Flatten())
     model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
     model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
     ```

4. **Compile the Model:**
   - Choose an appropriate loss function (binary crossentropy for binary classification), optimizer (e.g., Adam), and metrics.
     ```python
     model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
     ```

5. **Training the Model:**
   - Feed the training data into the model using `model.fit`.
     ```python
     model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=num_epochs, validation_data=(val_images, val_labels))
     ```

6. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Use the test dataset to evaluate the model's performance.
     ```python
     test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
     print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')
     ```

7. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
     ```python
     predictions = model.predict(new_images)
     ```

8. **Fine-Tuning (Optional):**
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters or experiment with different architectures to improve performance.

9. **Save and Deploy (Optional):**
   - Save the trained model for future use and deploy it in applications for real-time predictions.

This is a basic overview, and the actual implementation may involve additional details and considerations based on the specific requirements and nuances of the dataset.
